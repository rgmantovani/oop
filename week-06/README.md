# Week 6: Inheritance - Part 2 (Multiple Inheritance)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand multiple inheritance
- Learn about the diamond problem
- Master Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python
- Understand virtual inheritance in C++
- Learn when to use multiple inheritance

## Topics Covered
1. Multiple Inheritance Syntax
2. Diamond Problem and Solutions
3. Method Resolution Order (Python)
4. Virtual Inheritance (C++)
5. Mix-in Classes
6. Best Practices for Multiple Inheritance

## Key Concepts
Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class.
Python handles this with MRO, C++ uses virtual inheritance for diamond problem.
