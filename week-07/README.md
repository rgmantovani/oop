# Week 7: Polymorphism - Part 1 (Method Overloading & Overriding)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand polymorphism concept
- Learn method overloading techniques
- Master method overriding
- Understand dynamic binding
- Learn about virtual functions in C++

## Topics Covered
1. Polymorphism Concept
2. Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)
3. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
4. Virtual Functions in C++
5. Dynamic Method Dispatch
6. The `super()` function

## Key Concepts
Polymorphism means "many forms" - same interface, different implementations.
