# Week 4: Encapsulation and Access Modifiers

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principle of encapsulation
- Learn about access modifiers (public, private, protected)
- Master getter and setter methods
- Understand property decorators in Python
- Learn about access control in C++

## Topics Covered
1. Encapsulation Principle
2. Access Modifiers: Public, Private, Protected
3. Getter and Setter Methods
4. Property Decorators (@property in Python)
5. Data Hiding and Information Hiding
6. Benefits of Encapsulation

## Key Concepts

### Access Control
**Python:**
- Public: `variable`
- Protected: `_variable` (convention)
- Private: `__variable` (name mangling)

**C++:**
- `public:` accessible from anywhere
- `private:` accessible only within class
- `protected:` accessible in class and derived classes

## Practical Examples
See `python/` and `cpp/` directories for implementations.
