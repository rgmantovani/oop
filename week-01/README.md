## Theory

### What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects rather than functions and logic. Objects are instances of classes that contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

### The Four Pillars of OOP

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), and controlling access to them.

2. **Inheritance**: Mechanism where a new class inherits properties and methods from an existing class.

3. **Polymorphism**: Ability of objects to take on multiple forms. The same method can behave differently for different objects.

4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

## Practical Examples

See the `python/` and `cpp/` directories for code examples in each language.

## Exercises

Check the `exercises/` directory for hands-on practice problems.
